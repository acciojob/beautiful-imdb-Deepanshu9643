	<p class="movieDetail">Interstellar is a 2014 science fiction epic directed by Christopher Nolan, starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain. The film is set in a dystopian future where Earth is ravaged by environmental collapse, threatening humanity's survival. Cooper (McConaughey), a former NASA pilot turned farmer, is recruited for a daring mission to explore a wormhole near Saturn. This wormhole offers a chance to find a new habitable planet.

The film masterfully intertwines themes of love, sacrifice, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge, as Cooper and his team navigate uncharted galaxies. They encounter mind-bending phenomena such as time dilation, which dramatically alters the passage of time. Meanwhile, on Earth, Cooper's daughter Murph (Chastain) works to solve the equations needed to save humanity.

Interstellar is lauded for its stunning visuals, scientifically grounded concepts, and emotional depth. The film explores the limits of human endurance and the boundless possibilities of space exploration, making it a thought-provoking and visually captivating cinematic experience.</p>
